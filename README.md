## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### Where do I get API keys?

- **Ideogram API Key**: Sign up at [Ideogram Platform](https://ideogram.ai/) to get your API key for image description features.

### How does the plugin choose which links to insert?
The AI analyzes your content's context and suggests the most relevant internal links based on semantic meaning, content relevance, and your site's structure.

### Can I edit the suggested links?
Yes! All AI-generated links can be manually edited or removed directly in the post editor. The plugin won't modify your changes during future updates.

### Will this affect my site's performance?
The plugin is optimized for minimal impact:
- AI processing happens asynchronously
- No frontend scripts are loaded for visitors
- Efficient database queries
- Built-in caching of AI responses

### How many links will be added to each post?
By default, up to 7 links are added, but you can adjust this in the settings. The actual number may be less if the AI can't find enough relevant content to link to.

The plugin automatically analyzes featured images using Ideogram AI when posts are saved or published. It only processes images that don't already have descriptive titles or alt text, creating SEO-friendly descriptions that improve accessibility and search rankings.
