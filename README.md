## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### Where do I get a DeepSeek API key?
Sign up at [DeepSeek Platform](https://platform.deepseek.com/) to get your API key. The free tier includes sufficient requests for most small to medium sites.

### How does the plugin choose which links to insert?
The AI analyzes your content's context and suggests the most relevant internal links based on semantic meaning, content relevance, and your site's structure.

### Can I edit the suggested links?
Yes! All AI-generated links can be manually edited or removed directly in the post editor. The plugin won't modify your changes during future updates.

### Will this affect my site's performance?
The plugin is optimized for minimal impact:
- AI processing happens asynchronously
- No frontend scripts are loaded for visitors
- Efficient database queries
- Built-in caching of AI responses
